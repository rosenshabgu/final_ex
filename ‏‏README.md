So much that 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone (Source: IBM). These extremely large datasets are hard to deal with using legacy systems such as RDBMS as data exceed the storage and processing capacity of database. The legacy systems are becoming obsolete.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Gartner: ?Big Data is new Oil?. Big Data is all about finding the needle of value in a haystack of Structured, Semi-structured and Un-structured data. Hadoop (the Solution of All Big Data Problems) has become the most important component in the data stack, which enables rapid processing of data at petabyte scale. Hadoop is expected to be at the core of more than half of all analytics software within the next two years. \\n #NEC, #Andhra Govt.

So much that 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone (Source: IBM). These extremely large datasets are hard to deal with using legacy systems such as RDBMS as data exceed the storage and processing capacity of database. The legacy systems are becoming obsolete.\\n\\nAccording to Gartner: ?Big Data is new Oil?. Big Data is all about finding the needle of value in a haystack of Structured, Semi-structured and Un-structured data. Hadoop (the Solution of All Big Data Problems) has become the most important component in the data stack, which enables rapid processing of data at petabyte scale. Hadoop is expected to be at the core of more than half of all analytics software within the next two years. \\n #NEC, #Andhra Govt.

This is a step in the right direction \\x96 now people won\\'t be held for crimes that are no longer crimes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe outdated policies of the War on Drugs have done little but waste federal resources and harm lives forever. But while some of us are fighting back, others \\x96 like Attorney General Jeff Sessions \\x96 are doggedly pursuing the same failed policies. His vendetta against marijuana and people who use it goes against public opinion and completely disregards the human consequences of these unjust laws. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut we can stop him. There\\'s a new bill in Congress to legalize marijuana under federal law \\x96 and remedy some of the injustices of the War on Drugs. We need your help to make sure it becomes law.\\r\\n\\r\\nTell your members of Congress to support the Marijuana Justice Act and reform our broken criminal justice system.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow do we know that reform is needed? The data says it all. In 2013 we found that Black people are almost four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession even though Black and white people use marijuana at comparable rates.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\\'s more, 64 percent of Americans approve of legalizing marijuana.

They were perfectly adapted to the conditions of the ice age, but disappeared somewhere 20,000-30000 years ago. They were replaced by Cro-Magnens, who became the progenitors of modern people.\\r\\nHowever, it is proved that the genes of Neanderthals are in the genome of modern man.\\r\\nThe main part of the Neanderthal diet was meat. These are proteins and fats.\\r\\nOnly in the liver is glycogen in a relatively large amount.\\r\\nProceeding from this, gluconeogenesis was very characteristic for the metabolism of Neanderthals. Vegetable food accounted for a very small percentage of their diet.\\r\\nThe diet of Neanderthals was very similar to the diet of modern brown bears: meat, fish, snails, berries, roots and leaves of plants.\\r\\nWith the melting of glaciers, vast spaces of free land opened up, which were filled with plants, including berries: raspberries, blueberries, acorns. They can be dried and mixed with meat. The Indians still know the recipe for phemikana.\\r\\nHowever, an increase in the percentage of carbohydrates in the diet led Neanderthal women to polycystic ovary syndrome and a decrease in fertility.\\r\\nIt has already been proved that the Neanderthals crossed with the Cro-Magnens.\\r\\nWomen with part of the genes of the Cro-Magnens were more fertile, because the Cro-Magnens lived in a warmer climate and consumed more carbohydrates. Gluconeogenesis in them was less pronounced, fertility is higher, their descendants and replaced net Neanderthals can and pure Kromiens who could not tolerate the cold. There was a highly adaptive race that occupied all the earth and displaced all other hominids.\\r\\n??? ????? ???????? ??????????????.\\r\\n????????????? ?????????????? ?? ?????????? ??????????? ?????? ????? 200000 ???. ??? ???? ????????? ????????????? ? ???????? ??????????? ???????, ?????? ??????? ??? ?? 20000-30000 ??? ?????. ?? ??????? ???????????, ??????? ????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????.\\r\\n?????? ????????, ??? ???? ?????????????? ????????? ? ?????? ???????????? ????????.\\r\\n???????? ????? ????? ????????????? ?????????? ????. ??? ????? ? ????.\\r\\n?????? ? ?????? ???? ???????? ? ???????????? ??????? ??????????.\\r\\n?????? ?? ????? ????????????? ??? ????? ?????????? ??? ??????????? ??????????????. ???????????? ???? ?????????? ????? ????? ??????? ? ?? ???????.\\r\\n?????? ?????????????? ??? ????? ????? ?? ?????? ??????????? ????? ????????: ????,????, ??????, ?????, ????? ? ?????? ????????.\\r\\n??? ?????? ???????? ??????????? ???????? ???????????? ????????? ?????, ??????? ??????????? ??????????, ? ??? ????? ? ????????: ???????, ????????, ?????????. ?? ????? ?????? ? ????????? ? ?????. ??????? ?? ??? ??? ????? ?????? ????????. \\r\\n?????? ?????????? ???????? ????????? ? ??????? ???????? ? ?????? ?????????????? ? ???????? ????????????? ???????? ? ???????? ????????????. \\r\\n??? ???????? ???,????????????? ???????????? ? ?????????????.\\r\\n??????? ??????? ????? ????? ???????????? ???? ????? ?????????, ?????? ??? ??????????? ???? ? ????? ?????? ??????? ? ?????????? ?????? ?????????. ????????????? ? ??? ??? ????? ???????, ???????????? ????,?? ??????? ?  ????????? ?????? ?????????????? ????? ? ?????? ????????????, ??????? ?? ?????????? ?????. ???????? ?????? ?????????? ????, ??????? ?????? ??? ????? ? ????????? ???? ?????? ?????????. \\n Trump\\'s ascension to the leader. \\n Here is a short list of items that may contain cochineal-derived colorant: \\n \"Equifax has said it is under investigation by every state attorney general and faces more than 240 class action lawsuits.\"...\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time a headline like this would have been unbelievable,\\r\\n-- but w/the bastards \\'running the show\\' today, No Longer.\\r\\n\\r\\n*\\r\\n\\r\\nEquifax (EFX.N) said in September that hackers stole personal data it had collected on some 143 million Americans.

It also implies that the sum of matter plus energy never changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn nuclear reactions, ( both fission, where atoms are split and in fusion, where atoms are combined ) energy is produced in just this very way...by the complete annihilation of matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the stars in the universe, including our own sun, of course, use fusion to produce energy. Deep in the interior of stars, atoms of hydrogen are combined or FUSED into helium. But the mass of the resulting helium is less than the mass of the hydrogen, and it is that \"missing\" mass that is turned into energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nStars may be thought of as islands of intensely concentrated energy in a vast interstellar void. It\\'s a system, though, a universe, whose organization ( pockets of energy here and nothingness there ) is being constantly eroded, dismantled, degraded.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, the degree of organization of the universe is constantly on the decrease, while the overall disorder, called entropy, is inexorably on the the rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually this disorder, entropy, will reach a maximum as all the stars inevitably exhaust their supply of fuel and cease producing energy altogether. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey will shine no more. There will be no more \"islands of energy\"...no concentration of energy here and nothingness there. What scientists call the temperature gradient will cease to exist and that means no more usable energy available for ANYTHING.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, there will be a uniform sameness throughout the cosmos. The temperature from one \"end\" of the universe to the other will be the same...just a few degrees above absolute zero. \\r\\n\\r\\nAppropriately enough, this is what scientists call the \"heat death\" of the cosmos. And it will be the end of absolutely EVERYTHING. There is, however, a great unknown in this dooms day scenario...dark energy and its role in the ultimate fate of the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill this enigmatic \"stuff\" change the outcome?\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody knows.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome say, yes, the the cosmos will end with a whimper as in the heat death scenario described above...in other words, the end will come with a quiet \"whimper\". Others say, no the universe will continue expanding forever. Still others say, the universe will collapse into a singularity, the so-called \"Big Crunch\".\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless, whatever the fate of the universe...the ultimate catastrophe, if it happens at all won\\'t likely occur for billions, if not trillions of years. So no need to worry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if it continues expanding indefinitely, well, we need not worry about that either, cuz that portends nothing catastrophic...as far as we know now. \\n The only thing that\\'s changed since then is it\\'s gotten worse. \\n Blue moon over Blackpool, UK, Jan 30, 2018.

But a leaked draft of the plan show it\\'s nothing more than a scam. It calls for cutting or significantly changing at least 10 bedrock environmental laws to make it easier for corporations to bypass critical protections for air, water, and wildlife. Instead of putting Americans to work rebuilding crumbling infrastructure, the Trump infrastructure scam is the administration\\'s latest giveaway to the oil and gas industry. The only clear winners from this plan are corporate developers, while communities, workers, and the environment face untold threats. And there\\'s no clear economic benefit from this plan, as it will decimate the Highway Trust Fund, cutting jobs and crucial infrastructure projects.\\r\\nAs far as environmental risks, this scam is one of the worst. It would prioritize polluter profits and cut communities out of the decision-making process for major developments in their neighborhoods. Corporations would be able to sidestep public health, worker safety, and environmental protections for infrastructure projects, including for toll roads, pipelines, drilling projects, and new mines. It allows polluters to skirt landmark public health protections like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, all while depriving funding for improvements for clean drinking water systems. It even grants authority to Interior Secretary (and friend of the oil and gas industry) Ryan Zinke to unilaterally approve new gas pipelines through National Parks. The Trump administration will attempt to brand these environmental attacks as an effort to improve the infrastructure permitting process. In actuality, they are attempting to steamroll hardworking Americans by silencing their voices in determining where pipelines, highways, and other large projects should be built, all to boost industry profits.\\r\\nBut Americans won\\'t be duped by anything that puts us, our families, and our outdoor places at risk. A recent poll found that 94% of voters reject the idea that we have to put our health and outdoors at risk to improve our nation\\'s infrastructure. So when Trump tries to use the State of the Union speech tomorrow to sell us on an infrastructure plan, we\\'ll see it for what it is: a scam.\\r\\n\\r\\nACTION OF THE DAY\\r\\n#HandsOff Our Medicaid. Earlier this month, the Trump administration ended Medicaid as we know it, allowing states to enact punitive work requirements as part of their Medicaid programs. The majority of working-age Medicaid recipients are already working\\x97and majority of those who are not are either ill or disabled, caring for a loved one, or going to school. This decision has put 6.3 million Americans\\' health insurance at risk, and it kicks struggling workers while they\\'re down. And according to a new report, the state of Kentucky will go a step further\\x97requiring people who have lost their Medicaid to pass a health or financial literacy test to get health care back, harkening back to racist literacy tests in the Jim Crow South. It\\'s the latest in his attacks on crucial programs that help families make ends meet\\x97so take action today! Add your name to our petition urging the Trump administration to reverse their decision and keep their #HandsOff our Medicaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT\\'S TRENDING\\r\\nAttacking Reproductive Rights. Tonight, the Senate will vote on a 20-week abortion ban. The procedural vote has been scheduled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who promised a vote early this year after the House passed the bill a few months ago. What effects would such a restrictive ban have on women across the country? Twenty weeks is the time when women have an ultrasound that helps determine if the child will survive after birth. Read stories of women that reveal why the ban would be so harmful. In addition to the harmful effects, our country just acknowledged the 45th anniversary of Roe v. Wade one week ago. Such a ban would clearly violate Roe v. Wade, and thus, is unconstitutional. Even if this particular legislation fails, it reminds us to stay vigilant and continue to fight for women\\'s rights to access safe, affordable abortion care.\\r\\n#TimesUp at the Grammys. Last night, some of the biggest music stars in the country gathered for the 60th Grammy Awards. Just like the stars at the Golden Globes, many attendees showed up in support of #TimesUp, the initiative to end sexual misconduct in the workplace, by wearing white roses. Kesha gave a stunning, emotional performance of her anthem \"Praying,\" which reflects on her survival after her own experiences with sexual assault and abuse. But despite the spotlight given to #TimesUp and #MeToo, gender diversity remains a huge problem for the music industry. In fact, a new study from the University of Southern California \"showed that in the past six years, more than 90 percent of Grammy nominees have been men \\x97 a statistic that\\'s come up a lot as the industry begins to grapple with sexual misconduct.\" And, women only won one of the 10 awards broadcast during the show last night. It\\'s clear that the music industry\\x97as well as every other industry across America\\x97needs more than just gestures or roses to bring about real change.\\r\\n\\r\\nOFF-KILTER\\r\\nDog-Whistling Donald. In the aftermath of the blatantly racist \"shithole\" comment from President Trump, the latest episode of the Off-Kilter podcast explores Trump\\'s more subtle racism, and whether that is actually more dangerous. Hear from former NAACP head Cornell Brooks and longtime disability rights advocate Patrick Cokley on these issues and why people are afraid to use the word \"racist.\" And then don\\'t miss a conversation with Inge Fryklund\\x97a former Assistant State\\'s Attorney in Cook County who serves on the board of Law Enforcement Action Partnership, an organization devoted to criminal justice reform and stopping the war on drugs\\x97about the law enforcement case for legalization.\\r\\n\\r\\nUNDER THE RADAR\\r\\nTracking Your Car. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has a new, powerful tool in their hands\\x97and it\\'s raising concerns about people\\'s civil liberties. According to reports, ICE now has access \"to billions of license plate records and new powers of real-time location tracking.\" While this is concerning for all Americans, it is especially concerning for immigrants, given ICE\\'s focus on sweeping up anyone it comes in contact with, even long time family and community members. This new tool will make it easier for ICE to expand its enforcement overdrive apparatus; in addition, it could lead to more people avoiding registering their cars, \"a public safety hazard.\" \\n We all knew this was coming. \\n Check out my new laboratory!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich is the \"monster\"?\\r\\nFRANKENSTEIN - Mondays at 7 PM\\r\\nwww.TheFrankensteinMusical.com\\r\\nmusic, book & lyrics by Eric Sirota physicist/composer/playwright \\n When Trump said we\\'d be back in the lead.... this wasn\\'t what I had in mind  :/ \\n In perpetuity. \\n \"Law Enforcement\" (cont.) \\n Hey!

(Y) \\n FYI...\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy do we get goose bumps when exposed to cold temps and in situations which evoke fear, when we\\'re skeet?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe short answer is that this reaction to threatening situations and frigid conditions is an evolutionary throw back.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are descended from primates whose body was covered with hair and fur. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor these early creatures, it was a survival advantage if they were able to appear larger and more formidable to enemies. How to do that? Cause each hair on the body to become erect. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn freezing conditions, it was a survival advantage also to erect each hair on the body, because this action trapped body heat and provided additional insulation from the cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat erected body hair? Tiny muscles near the skin\\'s surface. When these muscles are activated they form small \"pimples\" or goose bumps.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, we\\'re no longer covered with fur, but the muscles that erected the hair in our ancestors remain with us. \\n \"Maybe that is a good idea.

I\\'m exhausted from having to give all the sh*ts about people that you\\'re supposed to be giving\\x97along with my own.\\r\\nI\\'m worn out from keeping up on legislation and watching hearings and staying on top of details and remembering deadlines and imploring action\\x97while you go about your day as if such things are an annoyance, is if they are a disruption of your plan, as if the expiration date for my outrage has long come and gone.\\r\\nI am absolutely burnt out from trying to make my voice loud enough to counteract not only the bad people\\'s incredible volume\\x97but your deafening silence. Both of these things are doing similar damage right now, sadly.\\r\\nBelieve me, I understand that my activism is a problem for you. Please know that your inactivism is similarly problematic for me. It\\'s part of the reason I am as angry as I am; because I\\'m not only having to fight against those who seem furiously bent on hurting people\\x97I\\'m having to fight against those who don\\'t seem give enough of a damn that they are doing so, to say anything.\\r\\nLook, I get it, I really do. It\\'s difficult to see so much bad news, to fully face the relentless flood of terrible, to try and wrap your brain around seemingly boundless cruelty around you. It\\'s tiresome to spend so much time with a closed fist. I know it\\'s even a pain in the rear end to endure the continual rantings of people like me on your news feed and in your timeline and across the dinner table and in the break room.\\r\\nI\\'m tired of me too.\\r\\nI\\'m sick of the fight too.\\r\\nI\\'m sick of the sound of my own voice.\\r\\nI\\'d rather not be doing this either.\\r\\nI\\'d much rather prefer to just enjoy life, to forget about it all, to only post pictures of puppies and my kids, and to simply ignore all that \"political garbage.\"\\r\\nBut that is what privilege looks like; to even believe I have such an option, to have the great luxury of living without urgency because I can seemingly shield myself from it all.\\r\\nThat is what the bad people are counting on. They\\'re counting on good people who are too tired, too apathetic, too selfish, or to oblivious to sustain their outrage. I am not going to give that gift to them.\\r\\nAs long as they\\'re fully invested in putting people through hell, I\\'m going to be as invested in pushing back against it.\\r\\nI think the people I love are worth it.\\r\\nI think you and the people you love are worth it.\\r\\nI think people I\\'ll never meet are worth it.\\r\\nAnd that\\'s the rub here: love will often look a lot like rage, as it fiercely fights on behalf of those who are being attacked. \\r\\nSo yes, angry is not all that I am, but I am rightly angry.\\r\\nAnd it would be really helpful if we could carry the load of outrage right now. \\r\\nThat would actually be a source of rest and joy and breath.\\r\\nFriend, if you really want me to be less angry, you might try being a little more angry.\\r\\nI am angry, friend.\\r\\nI wish you were angry too. \\n Davos meeting -- Live now. \\n Trump\\'s Attorney Lay\\'s Down the Law! \\n Are you a Scientist who loves Science Fiction?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if so, may I ask for help with a Science Fiction Story? \\n Tiffany Foster-Grant I have a problem with the Ten Commandments. Here it is: Why are there ten? We don\\'t need that many. I think the list of commandments was deliberately and artificially inflated to get it up to ten. It\\'s clearly a padded list.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\\'s how it happened: About five thousand years ago, a bunch of reli\\xadgious and political hustlers got together to figure out how they could control people and keep them in line. They knew people were basically stupid and would believe anything they were told, so these guys announced that God\\x97 God personally\\x97had given one of them a list of Ten Commandments that he wanted everyone to follow. They claimed the whole thing took place on a mountaintop, when no one else was around.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut let me ask you something: When these guys were sittin\\' around the tent makin\\' all this up, why did they pick ten? Why ten? Why not nine, or eleven? I\\'ll tell you why. Because ten sounds important. Ten sounds official. They knew if they tried eleven, people wouldn\\'t take them seriously. People would say, \"What\\'re you kiddin\\' me? The Eleven Commandments? Get the fuck outta here!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut ten! Ten sounds important. Ten is the basis for the decimal system; it\\'s a decade. It\\'s a psychologically satisfying number: the top ten; the ten most wanted; the ten best-dressed. So deciding on Ten Commandments was clearly a marketing decision. And it\\'s obviously a bullshit list. In truth, it\\'s a politic; document, artificially inflated to sell better.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m going to show you how you can reduce the number of commandments and come up with a list that\\'s a bit more logical and realistic. We\\'ll start with the first three, and I\\'ll use the Roman Catholic version because those are the ones I was fed as a little boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x95 I AM THE LORD THY GOD, THOU SHALT NOT HAVE STRANGE\\r\\nGODS BEFORE ME.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x95 THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN\\r\\nVAIN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x95 THOU SHALT KEEP HOLY THE SABBATH.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, right off the bat, the first three commandments\\x97pure bullshit \"Sabbath day,\" \"Lord\\'s name,\" \"strange gods.\" Spooky language. Spooky language designed to scare and control primitive people. In no way does superstitious mumbo jumbo like this apply to the lives of intelligent, civilized human in the twenty-first century. You throw out the first three commandments, am you\\'re down to seven.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x95HONOR THY FATHER AND MOTHER.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis commandment is about obedience and respect for authority; in other words it\\'s simply a device for controlling people. The truth is, obedience and respect should not be granted automatically. They should be earned. They should be based on the parents\\' performance. Some parents deserve respect. Most of them don\\'t. Period. We\\'re down to six.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in the interest of logic\\x97something religion has a really hard time with\\x97I\\'m going to skip around the list a little bit:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x95 THOU SHALT NOT STEAL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x95 THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS.\\r\\n\\r\\nStealing and lying. Actually, when you think about it, these two com\\xadmandments cover the same sort of behavior: dishonesty. Stealing and lying. So we don\\'t need two of them. Instead, we combine these two and call it \"Thou shalt not be dishonest.\" Suddenly we\\'re down to five.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as long as we\\'re combining commandments I have two others that be\\xadlong together:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x95 THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTERY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x95 THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR\\'S WIFE.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, these two prohibit the same sort of behavior; in this case, mar\\xadital infidelity. The difference between them is that coveting takes place in the mind. And I don\\'t think you should outlaw fantasizing about someone else\\'s wife, otherwise what\\'s a guy gonna think about when he\\'s waxing his carrot?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut marital fidelity is a good idea, so I suggest we keep the idea and call this commandment \"Thou shalt not be unfaithful.\" Suddenly we\\'re down to four.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when you think about it further, honesty and fidelity are actually parts of the same overall value. So, in truth, we could combine the two honesty commandments with the two fidelity commandments, and, using positive lan\\xadguage instead of negative, call the whole thing \"Thou shalt always be honest and faithful.\" And now we\\'re down to three.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x95THOU SHALT NOT COVET THY NEIGHBOR\\'S GOODS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis one is just plain stupid. Coveting your neighbor\\'s goods is what keeps the economy going: Your neighbor gets a vibrator that plays \"O Come All Ye Faithful,\" you want to get one, too. Coveting creates jobs. Leave it alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou throw out coveting and you\\'re down to two now: the big, combined honesty/fidelity commandment, and the one we haven\\'t mentioned yet:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x95THOU SHALT NOT KILL.\\r\\n\\r\\nMurder. The Fifth Commandment. But, if you give it a little thought, you realize that religion has never really had a problem with murder. Not really. More people have been killed in the name of God than for any other reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo cite a few examples, just think about Northern Ireland, the Middle East, the Crusades, the Inquisition, our own abortion-doctor killings and, yes, the World Trade Center to see how seriously religious people take Thou Shalt Not Kill. Apparently, to religious folks\\x97especially the truly devout\\x97murder is ne\\xadgotiable. It just depends on who\\'s doing the killing and who\\'s getting killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, with all of this in mind, folks, I offer you my revised list of the Two Commandments:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x95THOU SHALT ALWAYS BE HONEST AND FAITHFUL, ESPECIALLY\\r\\nTO THE PROVIDER OF THY NOOKIE.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd second:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x95THOU SHALT TRY REAL HARD NOT TO KILL ANYONE, UNLESS,\\r\\nOF COURSE, THEY PRAY TO A DIFFERENT INVISIBLE MAN\\r\\nTHAN THE ONE YOU PRAY TO.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo is all you need, folks. Moses could have carried them down the hill in his pocket. And if we had a list like that, I wouldn\\'t mind that brilliant judge in Alabama displaying it prominently in the courthouse wall. As long he in\\xadcluded one additional commandment:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\x95THOU SHALT KEEP THY RELIGION TO THYSELF! \\n Josh Ray, 35, was a husband and father of a young daughter.

The victims of the shooting \"ranged from 14 to 18 years old\"\\x97young people who have (or had) their whole lives in front of them. With such a brutal attack on high school students, you\\'d expect a nation in mourning, with media outlets covering the violence non-stop.\\r\\nBut you\\'d be wrong. The story barely broke through the 24/7 Trump news cycle, and most members of Congress didn\\'t even comment on the tragedy. The President of the United States didn\\'t say anything at all, even though he spent the morning tweeting. It\\'s really no surprise that Americans have become so incredibly desensitized to such violence. In fact, the school shooting in Kentucky was the 11th school shooting of 2018\\x97and we are only 24 days into the new year. And it\\'s not just these mass shootings that are putting young people in the U.S. at such high risk. Teenagers in the U.S. between the ages of 15 to 19 are 82 times more likely to die from gun violence than teenagers in peer countries. And remember: on an average day, 96 Americans are killed with guns.\\r\\nThese statistics are shocking, but once you\\'ve heard them before, they start to become normalized.

The next deadline is now February 8, and, in the meantime, 122 Dreamers are losing their protection every single day. We must continue to stand with Dreamers, and demand that Congress take action. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must be held accountable for his promises to bring legislation to the floor on DACA, and this legislation must provide a permanent solution for Dreamers, without compromising our values by allowing Stephen Miller and his allies to attach their anti-immigrant wishlist. Call your members of Congress today at 202-224-3121! Then, share the graphic below.\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT\\'S TRENDING\\r\\nGlobal Gag Rule. A year ago, President Trump used an executive order to reinstate and expand the Mexico City Policy, also known as the Global Gag Rule. First instituted in 1984 by then-President Ronald Reagan and rescinded most recently by then-President Barack Obama in 2009, the global gag rule restricts all U.S. global health aid from being used to support abortion in any way. Under Trump\\'s policy, U.S.-funded nongovernmental organizations are even restricted from using private, non-U.S. funds to offer abortion care, discuss abortion, or engage in activities to change restrictive abortion laws in the countries in which they work. The reinstatement of the Global Gag Rule will lead to an increase in unsafe abortions and pregnancy-related deaths among women in the poorest countries. Early analysis of the impacts of the policy shows reductions in critical reproductive health services that cannot easily be replaced.\\r\\nDitching Collection Agencies. Twelve Senators sent a letter to the Department of Education demanding it justifies the use of private collection agencies for federal student loans. Last year, the federal government paid these contractors almost a billion dollars to recover debt from about 7 million borrowers. But, a piece published today by the Center for American Progress points out that the government spent almost as much on debt collection as it did servicing accounts for 33 million borrowers who are currently in repayment. The column describes the pitfalls of using private collection agencies, and argues that borrowers would be better served by removing them from the student loan system.\\r\\nWelcoming Communities. Immigrating to the United States can be a challenging journey, but it is made much harder for LGBTQ immigrants. A new report by the Center for American Progress explains the unique challenges that LGBTQ immigrants face, as well as how cities, service providers, and philanthropic organizations can make communities more welcoming to those individuals. Given that LGBTQ unauthorized immigrants make up 17 percent of survivors of anti-LGBTQ hate violence, it is crucial that cities provide a host of services are made available to LGBTQ immigrants to help them feel safe, protected, and assist them in thriving in their new community. As the report details, the types of services necessary include, but are not limited to, legal, health, employment, housing, language access, and education. If the U.S. is to continue to serve as a beacon of hope for LGBTQ immigrants around the world, communities must reform immigration policies and take concrete actions to improve services to ensure they are safe havens.\\r\\n\\r\\nGOOD NEWS\\r\\nSecond Chances. In November, Florida voters are going to have the opportunity to restore voting rights for more than a million people with a felony record. Over 750,000 signatures were gathered, meaning that the proposed constitutional amendment can now appear on the ballot. As one of only four states with a lifetime ban on voting, the state of Florida\\'s harsh laws prohibit those with a prior felony conviction from getting a second chance\\x97but Floridians have a chance to change that.

This article is from Progress Report.\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday, a bipartisan group of senators agreed to end the shutdown, with the promise from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he would bring legislation on DACA to the floor. It is unclear what exactly this legislation would look like, although McConnell said it would be \"neutral\" and allow for an open amendment process. This could lead to amendments being offered by some of the most staunch anti-immigrant senators, such as Senator Tom Cotton, who helped write the cruel RAISE Act. Such nativist, racist policies would not only prevent common sense, bipartisan talks on immigration reform, but they would put more than just Dreamers at risk.\\r\\nThis agreement between moderates to end the shutdown without a permanent fix for Dreamers has drawn ire from many, including other senators, who question why McConnell should be trusted. Senator Claire McCaskill, who voted \"yes\" on ending the shutdown, claims that she is not relying on McConnell\\'s promise, but instead, the \"12 moderate Republican[s] who were willing to step forward in this.\" But remaining wary about these reassurances is not only understandable but necessary. Trump has refused to negotiate in good faith and showed that he does not actually want to help Dreamers by walking away from multiple global, bipartisan deals that could have averted this shutdown in the first place. He is more interested in appealing to the members of his base that are rabidly anti-immigrant, and these efforts to appease those individuals are being led by none other than Stephen Miller. It\\'s time for all members of Congress to stand up to such appalling policies and views and recommit to an America that welcomes immigrants with open arms.\\r\\nWe must continue to stand with Dreamers. The next deadline is now February 8th; but, in the meantime, another 2,000+ Dreamers will lose protection, in addition to the 17,000 that already have been exposed to risks of losing their jobs and deportation. If a permanent solution is not reached soon, the White House has already indicated it will start deporting Dreamers on March 5th.

These two principles were foundational to both his Special and his General Theory of Relativity. Although it\\'s counter intuitive...it\\'s nonetheless true...the passage of time is not constant. It\\'s variable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow so, you ask...The faster one travels relative to a stationary observer, the more SLOWLY time passes for the traveler compared to that observer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBUT, the weaker the gravity is for one individual compared to another, the more RAPIDLY time flows.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, weaker gravity SPEEDS UP time passage and a faster velocity SLOWS DOWN time passage..\\r\\n\\r\\nSo here we have two competing affects. The higher relative speed compared to someone stationary on the ground, means time for the passenger passes more SLOWLY.\\r\\n\\r\\nBUT the higher one is above those on the ground, the more the flow of time speeds UP.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust how then do these two competing phenomena affect an airline passenger flying 500 MPH at an altitude of 35,000 feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing 6 miles above the earth, where gravity is a tiny bit weaker than for those on the ground, means time for our passenger passes a bit faster.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, since passengers are traveling over 500 MPH, time flows a little more slowly than for people on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, which affect wins out?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it turns out, the weaker gravity at the higher altitude, speeds UP the flow of time, more than the higher velocity of the aircraft slows DOWN the flow of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese affects have actually been calculated for a passenger who racked up 10,000,000 frequent flier miles at 500 MPH.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur passenger aged 59 millionths of a second more than his homebody wife.

Now it\\'s Japan\\'s turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Jan. 18th, the Japanese space agency JAXA launched a small rocket from the Uchinoura Space Center. It made a big display. Japanese artist and photographer Kagaya captured dramatic images of the rocket\\'s exhaust glowing in the starry pre-dawn sky over the Pacific:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I watched the launch from Okinawa Island and photographed it using my Sony ?7RIII camera,\" says Kagaya, who has posted a must-see video of the event on Youtube:\\r\\n\\r\\nJapan\\'s new Epsilon rocket is relatively small, designed to launch scientific satellites at a fraction of the cost of its larger predecessors.

These clouds occur naturally around Earth\\'s poles, but they are very rare at lower latitudes such as Japan\\'s. In polar regions, noctilucent clouds are seeded by specks of meteor smoke, which become frosted by naturally occurring water vapor drifting up toward the edge of space.

The truth is that they do not annihilate, they become more particles, you can understand this as joining 2 and -2 gives you 0 and from this 0 you can get other particles like 1 or -1, also if you have a certain energy you can create particles that have that same energy, for example if you have 4 and -4, you can get 3 and -3 on one side and 1 and -1 on the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n4) The cosmic microwave background is the echo or the light of the Big Bang: It would really be the light emitted 400,000 years after the Big Bang, since before that important things happened like the time of the great unification, the inflationary era, the Hadron era, neutrino decoupling and much more. \\n \"The Republican tax bill departs from tradition to specifically target citizens of Democratic states with higher taxes via the elimination of the deductions for real estate taxes and state and local income taxes, both of which are more important in the coastal states where those taxes are high.

This force is independent of the kinetic energies of the masses (static solution). The left wing of the equation below is the interacting force (effect, action or cause) and the right wing is the result as reaction of mass M2. It is apparent that, in this interaction, a reason causes a result but is not affected from it. In a sense, the result fully depends on the reason, but the reason is independent of result it causes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Einstein field equations, the force relation works with a rather strange logic. Here too, the reason (the mass that creates the space-time curvature) is not affected by the result (the object following the shortest path along this curvature). There is also another unusual breaking off here: isolation of mathematics (geometry) from physics. The left side of the equation is the curved space-time geometry, while the right side is the physics thought to form this geometry. Physicist John Wheeler describes this situation as: \"Space-time tells the matter how to move, and matter tells the space-time how to curve\". The \"cause\" and the \"result\" guide each other, but any one of them cannot affect the other, because the one is abstract mathematics, and the other is tangible physics.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can hardly talk about cause-and-result relation in quantum physics. There is even no guarantee that a cause will have an expected consequence. There is complete uncertainty prevailing there and only possibilities are in question. Some basic particles of constant magnitude are responsible from force relations, so the reason (force) is not influenced by its result, such that the interaction process in micro and macrocosm work in totally different way. Therefore, efforts have almost no chance to achieve a unified theory with traditional physics logic.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, the cause and result (action and reaction) in the Field-Relative Model of the Universe (UF-ME) are interpreted together and inseparably (spotlight 10 in www.researchgate.net/publication/322317299). As you can see below, the right side of the equation is zero, and in the expression on the left side, the cause and result are considered together in a way that cannot be separated from each other. So, a reason causes a result and is affected by this result. In other words, a result emerges for some reason and becomes a part of the reason which is the source of its entity. Since the \"UF-ME\" is valid in every scale from atomic structure to cosmology, this form of relationship is universal. This way of operation in whole nature makes the dynamism and ceaseless change inevitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch functioning in the nature is known as \"dialectic of nature\". It can also be called as \"dialectic of interaction\" or \"dialectic of action and reaction\". The dialectical method emerged in the ancient Greek philosophy as a \"reasoning method using the antagonisms\". Since 19th Century German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel interpreted the universe as a concrete idea, he added a material content to the dialectical relation. Friedrich Engels another German philosopher defined the dialectic as the scientific theory of totality in the context of the relationship of opponents in his unfinished work \"Dialectic of Nature\". \\r\\n\\r\\nThe dialectical method was used in ancient Greece to reach the right result in idea debates. In Marxist literature this was the fundamental method to explain the historical evolution of societies. The UF-ME shows that the process of interaction in physical nature, based on action-reaction relation, is also a complete dialectical process. At each stage after the interaction process starts, the cause (force) is not the same as the one in previous stage, because it is affected from the reaction it created. The \"result\" in later stage will also change accordingly (continuous dynamism). In this process, cause and effect cannot be separated from each other and should be evaluated together (unity of opposites). In a sense, \"God does not play dice\". In my opinion the relativistic approach to the interaction in nature is the formulation of dialectic of nature and the UF-ME is the mathematical expression of this concept. \\r\\n\\r\\nMost readers know now, how this dialectical method (UF-ME) provides perfect solutions to gravitation and other major mysteries in cosmology and astronomy that cannot be explained by contemporary physics (www.researchgate.net/publication/321474644 and www.researchgate.net/publication/317845079). Please keep in mind that the UF-ME will present its principal revolutionary solutions at atomic and subatomic level.

The equation expresses all the entity energies of the masses together with spin and linear motion energies in the cause and effect context.  The figure below shows how this equation is formed in the case of two bodies. For an n-body system the equation can be generalized in the form of matrices. The figure shows the escape and spin field velocities of each mass at the point where the other mass is as well as their own spin and linear velocities. For the UF-ME, it is a decisive factor for how each mass perceives the total velocity fields that the other produces. The relative effective field distribution factor ?R, is obtained by dot product of two relative total field velocities perceived by each mass. The UF-ME is the gradient of (?_R/r). \\r\\nSome basic properties of UF-ME:\\r\\n Owing to the dot product of perceived total field velocities of each mass, the UF-ME both preserves the excellent symmetry of Newton\\'s universal law of gravitation and implements Einstein\\'s relativistic concept in its true nature.\\r\\n The force equation F=-GM_1 M_2 ?(?_R?r) is reduced to Newton\\'s universal law of gravitation if the masses have no kinetic energies (k_i  = 0 and v_i  =0), i.e., Newton\\'s law applies only to systems that are stationary relative to each other. The Newton law will lose its validity as the interacting objects accelerate. \\r\\n The equation uses the relative velocity of the masses to each other, the total mass of interacting objects and mass size ratio owing to the true inertial reference frame.  In this way, it becomes applicable the force relationship between any two masses each may have any size. For example, if the two interacting masses are equal then ? = 1, and if it is the sun-photon relationship or M_1?M_2 then ? = 0. \\r\\n The relative effective field distribution factor ?_R  of UF-ME includes both the causes (field velocities) and the results (kinetic energies of masses). In other words, the UF-ME interprets the cause and effect of an interaction simultaneously in a single and simple mathematical expression. \\r\\n In general, the relative effective field distribution factor ?_R has also polar and azimuthal components due to the relative linear and spin velocities of the masses. Therefore the solution of UF-ME gives lateral force components besides the main radial one. \\r\\n The UF-ME shows that gravitational repulsion is also possible under certain circumstances (www.researchgate.net/publication/317845079). We only familiar with the radial gravitational component (attractive only) from the conventional physics. \\r\\n The polar component of interacting force causes small masses to cluster at the equatorial plane of the main body (Spiral galaxies, planets positions in Solar system, Saturn\\'s rings, most recent observation of positions of Uranus\\' moons on its unusual equator plane etc.)  (Conventional theories require globular clusters only due to their spherically symmetric nature.)\\r\\n Azimuthal component causes all members of a balanced cluster system to revolve in the same direction which is the spin direction of the main body in the system (spiral galaxies and motion of the planets in the Solar system). (The spherical symmetric force relation requires rotating in random directions.)\\r\\nThe UF-ME is a single expression which is valid in every scale in the Universe. Readers can estimate that in the cosmic scale and visible universe with naked eye M_i?1 unit mass and r?1 unit distance while k_i?1, but in atomic and subatomic scale M_i?1 unit mass and r?1 unit distance while  k_i?1. The universal gravitation constant G  in UF-ME serves in every scale because it is a parameter specifying space fabric as indicated in one of previous spotlights. (In contemporary physics  G has no role at all in atomic scale). \\n Donald Trump\\'s least presidential moments so far... \\n Donald Trump\\'s least presidential moments so far... \\n Donald Trump\\'s least presidential moments so far... \\n Donald Trump\\'s least presidential moments so far... \\n From M Patricia McLaughlin...

Upwards of 99% of all species that once walked the earth, that once burrowed in the soil, inhabited the bodies of others, swam in the oceans and rivers or flew in the atmosphere above...are no more. They are extinct. The scientific data ( the fossil record ) indisputably confirms it. Again 99%...gone!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn almost every instance, organisms disappeared because of their failure to adapt to a changing environment: they failed to adapt to drastic weather alterations; failed to find new habitats after theirs was destroyed; fell victim to invasive predators; or they were annihilated by asteroid impacts, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nFaced with an inability to cope, to change with conditions that threatened their very survival, they succumbed en mass, completely disappearing, never to return again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so humans must face the age old question: will our species follow suit or will we be the exception to this fatal fate of our own species ? \\r\\n\\r\\nWill our superior intelligence enable us to beat those odds? Will we able to adapt...to outwit what has been the inevitable death knell for most every other creature?\\r\\n\\r\\nOr will our willful ignorance, our false sense of superiority and invulnerable result in the exact opposite...will these foibles be our undoing...will they result in the same fate that befell the doomed 99%?\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther, do we have the will to determine which direction our intellect will lead us? Will our failure to mitigate the effects of climate change with all its dire consequences spell the eventual end? Will over use of anti-biotics do us in? Will thermonuclear global warfare be the end of our reign on earth?\\r\\n\\r\\nOur planet has already undergone 5 mass extinction events. We are overdue for the 6th. Will we be its victims?\\r\\n\\r\\nFifty, one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand years from now, will we have become extinct like the thousands of other species. Could we have prevented, but because of sheer stupidity didn\\'t? \\r\\n\\r\\nAs Carl Sagan once said, \"there is no evidence that help will ever come from any outside source to save us from ourselves.

And it is that this same volcano already caused in 1963 a global cooling of the Earth that was estimated of two years of duration.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlert status in Bali\\r\\nLast Saturday the authorities of this beautiful Indonesian island raised the alert level as the ash cloud became even more important, ordering the immediate evacuation of around 40,000 people in the area with the perspective that this week it would be necessary to evict a total of of 100,000 inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut many of them are not willing to leave their belongings and their animals, perhaps because it is not the first time that the Balinese see Agung spitting ash into the atmosphere and are accustomed to its roar. The previous major eruption dates from 1963 and left 1,600 dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe temperature of the Planet dropped to two degrees\\r\\nAfter that violent explosion of ash and gases to the Indonesian sky, the scientists detected in the two following years a global cooling of the temperature of the planet between 1 and 2 ?C.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther volcanoes that caused similar eruptions later, such as Mount St. Helens in 1980 (the most disastrous eruption in the history of the United States) did not have the same impact on Earth\\'s climate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe explanation is fundamentally due to two factors: the presence of sulfur in large proportions and the height at which the fumes and gases are high in the eruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relevant role of sulfur in modifying the climate\\r\\nFor an eruption of this type to be able to modify the climate of the planet it must happen that the cloud of ash and gases is able to reach the stratosphere, an area of ??the atmosphere where these compounds can block the arrival of solar energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd is that the high presence of sulfur dioxide makes the filtering of sunlight more effective, contributing more importantly to reduce the temperature of the planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgung is located in an area of ??the Planet that, due to its latitude, has the stratosphere at an altitude higher than other regions closer to the Poles, and this is another handicap for ash and sulfur to block the sun\\'s energy, unless the eruption is as powerful as that of 1963 and get rise above the troposphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe closest precedent that managed to modify Earth\\'s climate was Mount Pinatubo (Philippines) when it erupted in 1991, sending 20 billion tons of sulfur dioxide to the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.cazatormentas.com/sera-capaz-el-volcan-agung-de-enfriar-el-clima-del-planeta \\n More FAKE NEWS encountered via a Graphic Meme I stumbled across...\\r\\n\\r\\n*\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not believe that meme claiming a group of baboons is called a congress.

These two principles were foundational to both his Special and his General Theory of Relativity. Although it\\'s counter intuitive...it\\'s nonetheless true...the passage of time is not constant. It\\'s variable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow so, you ask...The faster one travels relative to a stationary observer, the more SLOWLY time passes for the traveler compared to that observer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBUT, the weaker the gravity is for one individual compared to another, the more RAPIDLY time flows.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, weaker gravity SPEEDS UP time passage and a faster velocity SLOWS DOWN time passage..\\r\\n\\r\\nSo here we have to competing affects. The higher relative speed compared to someone stationary on the ground, means time for the passenger passes more SLOWLY.\\r\\n\\r\\nBUT the higher one is above those on the ground, the more the flow of time speeds UP.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust how then do these two competing phenomena affect an airline passenger flying 500 MPH at an altitude of 35,000 feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing 6 miles above the earth, where gravity is a tiny bit weaker than for those on the ground, means time for our passenger passes a bit faster.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, since passengers are traveling over 500 MPH, time flows a little more slowly than for people on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, which affect wins out?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it turns out, the weaker gravity at the higher altitude, speeds UP the flow of time, more than the higher velocity of the aircraft slows DOWN the flow of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese affects have actually been calculated for a passenger who racked up 10,000,000 frequent flier miles at 500 MPH.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur passenger aged 59 millionths of a second more than his homebody wife. He has traveled that far into the future compared to folks who kept their feet on the ground. \\n Well, if you didn\\'t think things could get worse, they are apparently about to get a whole lot worse.\\r\\nYour rights of equal access to information and communication on the Internet hangs by a thread, and if this \\'gutting\\' of Net Neutrality goes through, what you see and access online will be able to be influenced and controlled by dark money. :/\\r\\nPlease share \\n NEW: Earth-like exoplanet found orbiting the star Ross 128:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://youtu.be/QkRgGRHA4ao?list=PL3RiFKfZj3pv1ZqpFxuZinoGtUGEOankw\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease share this post and comment below. \\n From Kevin G.

The training data I have has 5 attributes, 4 of which are independent.2 of the independent attributes are continuous and 2 are discrete.I have been working to fit this data into Logistic Regression model and generate Predictions. Now on this background I have couple of questions for which I require answers  -\\r\\n\\r\\nQ1). Does the ratio of my negative and positive cases in the training data affects learning of my Regression Model ?\\r\\nQ2).

There are about 8 or so variations of the process itself (some of which even merge but I want to ignore that for now). The process also has a handful of different outcomes. We know the duration of the process for all settings and outcome types although one outcome is \\'un-outcomed\\' which has a duration from origin until \\'today\\' (rolling).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some values for how long the process \\'should\\' take but sometimes it takes longer.\\r\\n\\r\\n What I want is one-big-in-your-face graphic that shows all of that.\\r\\n\\r\\nA table won\\'t do it. A crude tree diagram won\\'t do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI need a tree diagram template that allows me to do the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor each origin show branches from a tree with widths determined by the relative frequency of that source. For each sub-type of the process twigs coming off those branches also with their width determined by relative frequency of the whole. Twigs should vary in length with the average duration of that sub-type coming from that origin.

And I take this as a sign that there is a desire for a forum like this to share ideas with other data scientists and individuals interested in big data.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the group grew in size, there were gradually more and more posts which were job offers or offers for various forms of training. I decided to allow this because at the time I felt that it these might be valuable resources for members in the community. However, this trend has spiraled out of hand and it now feels like those types of messages have drowned out the fruitful exchange of ideas that we once had in the community.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, as of Saturday January 11th 2014, any posts that are advertisements will be deleted and will be grounds for banishment from the group. This includes but is not limited to posts about job offers and paid trainings. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you wish to share information about a free educational resource such as new course on Coursera, edX or Udacity that you plan to sign up for or have taken in the past that is perfectly ok. You can also share about books, blog posts and podcasts that you have found useful so long as it is not self-promotion. Use common sense when sharing with the community.\\r\\n\\r\\nWishing you all the best in your data science journey! - Henrik Nordmark \\n Hi,\\r\\n\\r\\nAnybody want,\\r\\n\\r\\nHadoop Big-data  latest training videos \\r\\n\\r\\nOracle BPM  11g Training videos\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle SOA developer 11g Training videos\\r\\n\\r\\nsap-security & BI  pl/sql\\r\\n\\r\\nselenium -software testing\\r\\n\\r\\ncore java\\r\\n \\r\\nTraining videos\\r\\n\\r\\nIt contains 40 hours training session\\r\\n\\r\\nYou just send me a  mail to  alya9642@gmail.com\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Not for Free\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mail mention your Name,Place of living, and Contact Number !!\\r\\n\\r\\nNot for windows viewers! \\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\'t comment send me a mail only!\\r\\n \\r\\nThank you ! \\n Hi,\\r\\n\\r\\nAnybody want \\r\\n\\r\\nOracle BPM  11g Training videos\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle SOA developer 11g Training videos\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle Weblogic Admin 11g Training videos\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle OSB developer Video  11g Training videos\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle  AIA  11g Training videos\\r\\n\\r\\nOracle  ODI  11g Training videos\\r\\n\\r\\nYou just send me a  mail to  alya9642@gmail.com\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Not for Free\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mail mention your Name and Place of living !!\\r\\n\\r\\nNot for windows viewers! \\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\'t comment send me a mail only!\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you ! \\n Hi friends,i need one help, i have some data, the data is date wise sales report, i want to predict or forecast , the data having up and down in graph.. so which model is suitable this situation? any body help me.. i need ur helps...   \\n Hi,\\r\\nAnybody want,\\r\\nHadoop Big-data  latest training videos \\r\\nOracle BPM  11g Training videos\\r\\nOracle SOA developer 11g Training videos\\r\\nYou just send me a  mail to  alya9642@gmail.com\\r\\nNote: Not for Free\\r\\nIn the mail mention your Name,Place of living, and Contact Number !!\\r\\nNot for windows viewers! \\r\\nDon\\'t comment send me a mail only!\\r\\n \\r\\nThank you ! \\n respected sir\\'s,and friends.i am ramana,i am very new to hadoop.i have the theoretical knowledge of hadoop,but don\\'t have any practical knowledge.i need your help,can any one give me any soft copy of commands and material of hadoop\\'s map reduce,pig,and hive.plzzz share to me,some information guysssss \\n respected sir\\'s,and friends.i am ramana,i am very new to hadoop.i have the theoretical knowledge of hadoop,but don\\'t have any practical knowledge.i need your help,can any one give me any soft copy of commands and material of hadoop\\'s map reduce,pig,and hive.plzzz share to me,some information guysssss \\n Hello.

dominated the territory of modern europe for over 200,000 years. they were perfectly adapted to the conditions of the ice age, but disappeared somewhere 20,000-30000 years ago. they were replaced by cro-magnens, who became the progenitors of modern people.\\nhowever, it is proved that the genes of neanderthals are in the genome of modern man.\\nthe main part of the neanderthal diet was meat. these are proteins and fats.\\nonly in the liver is glycogen in a relatively large amount.\\nproceeding from this, gluconeogenesis was very characteristic for the metabolism of neanderthals. vegetable food accounted for a very small percentage of their diet.\\nthe diet of neanderthals was very similar to the diet of modern brown bears: meat, fish, snails, berries, roots and leaves of plants.\\nwith the melting of glaciers, vast spaces of free land opened up, which were filled with plants, including berries: raspberries, blueberries, acorns. they can be dried and mixed with meat. the indians still know the recipe for phemikana.\\nhowever, an increase in the percentage of carbohydrates in the diet led neanderthal women to polycystic ovary syndrome and a decrease in fertility.\\nit has already been proved that the neanderthals crossed with the cro-magnens.\\nwomen with part of the genes of the cro-magnens were more fertile, because the cro-magnens lived in a warmer climate and consumed more carbohydrates. gluconeogenesis in them was less pronounced, fertility is higher, their descendants and replaced net neanderthals can and pure kromiens who could not tolerate the cold. there was a highly adaptive race that occupied all the earth and displaced all other hominids.\\n??? ????? ???????? ??????????????.\\n????????????? ?????????????? ?? ?????????? ??????????? ??????

twenty weeks is the time when women have an ultrasound that helps determine if the child will survive after birth. read stories of women that reveal why the ban would be so harmful. in addition to the harmful effects, our country just acknowledged the 45th anniversary of roe v. wade one week ago. such a ban would clearly violate roe v. wade, and thus, is unconstitutional. even if this particular legislation fails, it reminds us to stay vigilant and continue to fight for women\\'s rights to access safe, affordable abortion care.\\n#timesup at the grammys. last night, some of the biggest music stars in the country gathered for the 60th grammy awards. just like the stars at the golden globes, many attendees showed up in support of #timesup, the initiative to end sexual misconduct in the workplace, by wearing white roses. kesha gave a stunning, emotional performance of her anthem \"praying,\" which reflects on her survival after her own experiences with sexual assault and abuse. but despite the spotlight given to #timesup and #metoo, gender diversity remains a huge problem for the music industry. in fact, a new study from the university of southern california \"showed that in the past six years, more than 90 percent of grammy nominees have been men \\x97 a statistic that\\'s come up a lot as the industry begins to grapple with sexual misconduct.\" and, women only won one of the 10 awards broadcast during the show last night. it\\'s clear that the music industry\\x97as well as every other industry across america\\x97needs more than just gestures or roses to bring about real change.\\n\\noff-kilter\\ndog-whistling donald. in the aftermath of the blatantly racist \"shithole\" comment from president trump, the latest episode of the off-kilter podcast explores trump\\'s more subtle racism, and whether that is actually more dangerous. hear from former naacp head cornell brooks and longtime disability rights advocate patrick cokley on these issues and why people are afraid to use the word \"racist.\" and then don\\'t miss a conversation with inge fryklund\\x97a former assistant state\\'s attorney in cook county who serves on the board of law enforcement action partnership, an organization devoted to criminal justice reform and stopping the war on drugs\\x97about the law enforcement case for legalization.\\n\\nunder the radar\\ntracking your car. the immigration and customs enforcement (ice) agency has a new, powerful tool in their hands\\x97and it\\'s raising concerns about people\\'s civil liberties. according to reports, ice now has access \"to billions of license plate records and new powers of real-time location tracking.\" while this is concerning for all americans, it is especially concerning for immigrants, given ice\\'s focus on sweeping up anyone it comes in contact with, even long time family and community members. this new tool will make it easier for ice to expand its enforcement overdrive apparatus; in addition, it could lead to more people avoiding registering their cars, \"a public safety hazard.\" \\n we all knew this was coming. \\n check out my new laboratory!\\n\\nwhich is the \"monster\"?\\nfrankenstein - mondays at 7 pm\\nwww.thefrankensteinmusical.com\\nmusic, book & lyrics by eric sirota physicist/composer/playwright \\n when trump said we\\'d be back in the lead.... this wasn\\'t what i had in mind  :/ \\n in perpetuity. \\n \"law enforcement\" (cont.) \\n hey! j. willard gibbs! :o \\n nature science lesson.\\n\\n(file under \"framing\". how people employ words matters,\\n  so let\\'s not be \\'suckers\\'.) \\n \"trending.\" (cont.)\\n\\nfrom the archives (which just makes this more relevant imo).\\n  and so it goes... \\n i think i heard the line \"america first\" from the mother\\'s shirt in use these days... but... i doubt it, history never repeats itself, does it?

\\n are you a scientist who loves science fiction?\\n\\nand if so, may i ask for help with a science fiction story? \\n tiffany foster-grant i have a problem with the ten commandments. here it is: why are there ten? we don\\'t need that many. i think the list of commandments was deliberately and artificially inflated to get it up to ten. it\\'s clearly a padded list.\\n\\nhere\\'s how it happened: about five thousand years ago, a bunch of religious and political hustlers got together to figure out how they could control people and keep them in line. they knew people were basically stupid and would believe anything they were told, so these guys announced that god\\x97 god personally\\x97had given one of them a list of ten commandments that he wanted everyone to follow. they claimed the whole thing took place on a mountaintop, when no one else was around.\\n\\nbut let me ask you something: when these guys were sittin\\' around the tent makin\\' all this up, why did they pick ten? why ten? why not nine, or eleven? i\\'ll tell you why. because ten sounds important. ten sounds official. they knew if they tried eleven, people wouldn\\'t take them seriously. people would say, \"what\\'re you kiddin\\' me? the eleven commandments? get the fuck outta here!\"\\n\\nbut ten! ten sounds important. ten is the basis for the decimal system; it\\'s a decade. it\\'s a psychologically satisfying number: the top ten; the ten most wanted; the ten best-dressed. so deciding on ten commandments was clearly a marketing decision. and it\\'s obviously a bullshit list. in truth, it\\'s a politic; document, artificially inflated to sell better.\\n\\ni\\'m going to show you how you can reduce the number of commandments and come up with a list that\\'s a bit more logical and realistic. we\\'ll start with the first three, and i\\'ll use the roman catholic version because those are the ones i was fed as a little boy.\\n\\n\\x95 i am the lord thy god, thou shalt not have strange\\ngods before me.\\n\\n\\x95 thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in\\nvain.\\n\\n\\x95 thou shalt keep holy the sabbath.\\n\\nokay, right off the bat, the first three commandments\\x97pure bullshit \"sabbath day,\" \"lord\\'s name,\" \"strange gods.\" spooky language. spooky language designed to scare and control primitive people. in no way does superstitious mumbo jumbo like this apply to the lives of intelligent, civilized human in the twenty-first century. you throw out the first three commandments, am you\\'re down to seven.\\n\\n\\x95honor thy father and mother.\\n\\nthis commandment is about obedience and respect for authority; in other words it\\'s simply a device for controlling people. the truth is, obedience and respect should not be granted automatically. they should be earned. they should be based on the parents\\' performance. some parents deserve respect. most of them don\\'t. period. we\\'re down to six.\\n\\nnow, in the interest of logic\\x97something religion has a really hard time with\\x97i\\'m going to skip around the list a little bit:\\n\\n\\x95 thou shalt not steal.\\n\\n\\x95 thou shalt not bear false witness.\\n\\nstealing and lying. actually, when you think about it, these two commandments cover the same sort of behavior: dishonesty. stealing and lying. so we don\\'t need two of them. instead, we combine these two and call it \"thou shalt not be dishonest.\" suddenly we\\'re down to five.\\n\\nand as long as we\\'re combining commandments i have two others that belong together:\\n\\n\\x95 thou shalt not commit adultery.\\n\\n\\x95 thou shalt not covet thy neighbor\\'s wife.\\n\\nonce again, these two prohibit the same sort of behavior; in this case, marital infidelity. the difference between them is that coveting takes place in the mind. and i don\\'t think you should outlaw fantasizing about someone else\\'s wife, otherwise what\\'s a guy gonna think about when he\\'s waxing his carrot?\\n\\nbut marital fidelity is a good idea, so i suggest we keep the idea and call this commandment \"thou shalt not be unfaithful.\" suddenly we\\'re down to four.\\n\\nand when you think about it further, honesty and fidelity are actually parts of the same overall value. so, in truth, we could combine the two honesty commandments with the two fidelity commandments, and, using positive language instead of negative, call the whole thing \"thou shalt always be honest and faithful.\" and now we\\'re down to three.\\n\\n\\x95thou shalt not covet thy neighbor\\'s goods.\\n\\nthis one is just plain stupid. coveting your neighbor\\'s goods is what keeps the economy going: your neighbor gets a vibrator that plays \"o come all ye faithful,\" you want to get one, too. coveting creates jobs. leave it alone.\\n\\nyou throw out coveting and you\\'re down to two now: the big, combined honesty/fidelity commandment, and the one we haven\\'t mentioned yet:\\n\\n\\x95thou shalt not kill.\\n\\nmurder. the fifth commandment. but, if you give it a little thought, you realize that religion has never really had a problem with murder. not really. more people have been killed in the name of god than for any other reason.\\n\\nto cite a few examples, just think about northern ireland, the middle east, the crusades, the inquisition, our own abortion-doctor killings and, yes, the world trade center to see how seriously religious people take thou shalt not kill. apparently, to religious folks\\x97especially the truly devout\\x97murder is negotiable. it just depends on who\\'s doing the killing and who\\'s getting killed.\\n\\nand so, with all of this in mind, folks, i offer you my revised list of the two commandments:\\n\\nfirst:\\n\\n\\x95thou shalt always be honest and faithful, especially\\nto the provider of thy nookie.\\n\\nand second:\\n\\n\\x95thou shalt try real hard not to kill anyone, unless,\\nof course, they pray to a different invisible man\\nthan the one you pray to.\\n\\ntwo is all you need, folks. moses could have carried them down the hill in his pocket. and if we had a list like that, i wouldn\\'t mind that brilliant judge in alabama displaying it prominently in the courthouse wall. as long he included one additional commandment:\\n\\n\\x95thou shalt keep thy religion to thyself!

then, share the graphic below.\\n\\nwhat\\'s trending\\nglobal gag rule. a year ago, president trump used an executive order to reinstate and expand the mexico city policy, also known as the global gag rule. first instituted in 1984 by then-president ronald reagan and rescinded most recently by then-president barack obama in 2009, the global gag rule restricts all u.s. global health aid from being used to support abortion in any way. under trump\\'s policy, u.s.-funded nongovernmental organizations are even restricted from using private, non-u.s. funds to offer abortion care, discuss abortion, or engage in activities to change restrictive abortion laws in the countries in which they work. the reinstatement of the global gag rule will lead to an increase in unsafe abortions and pregnancy-related deaths among women in the poorest countries. early analysis of the impacts of the policy shows reductions in critical reproductive health services that cannot easily be replaced.\\nditching collection agencies. twelve senators sent a letter to the department of education demanding it justifies the use of private collection agencies for federal student loans. last year, the federal government paid these contractors almost a billion dollars to recover debt from about 7 million borrowers. but, a piece published today by the center for american progress points out that the government spent almost as much on debt collection as it did servicing accounts for 33 million borrowers who are currently in repayment. the column describes the pitfalls of using private collection agencies, and argues that borrowers would be better served by removing them from the student loan system.\\nwelcoming communities. immigrating to the united states can be a challenging journey, but it is made much harder for lgbtq immigrants. a new report by the center for american progress explains the unique challenges that lgbtq immigrants face, as well as how cities, service providers, and philanthropic organizations can make communities more welcoming to those individuals. given that lgbtq unauthorized immigrants make up 17 percent of survivors of anti-lgbtq hate violence, it is crucial that cities provide a host of services are made available to lgbtq immigrants to help them feel safe, protected, and assist them in thriving in their new community. as the report details, the types of services necessary include, but are not limited to, legal, health, employment, housing, language access, and education. if the u.s. is to continue to serve as a beacon of hope for lgbtq immigrants around the world, communities must reform immigration policies and take concrete actions to improve services to ensure they are safe havens.\\n\\ngood news\\nsecond chances. in november, florida voters are going to have the opportunity to restore voting rights for more than a million people with a felony record. over 750,000 signatures were gathered, meaning that the proposed constitutional amendment can now appear on the ballot. as one of only four states with a lifetime ban on voting, the state of florida\\'s harsh laws prohibit those with a prior felony conviction from getting a second chance\\x97but floridians have a chance to change that. head to secondchancesfl.org for more information about the ballot initiative and what it could mean for 1 in 10 floridians. \\n #new hope for #repairing a damaged or #aging #immune system https://goo.gl/9g2i6h \\n hydrogen bonds are what keeps cellulose fibers together to form paper... :o \\n \"it\\'s not up to you to decide!

astrophysics:\\n\\n1) the universe expands: the universe expands, it is true, but it does so at large scales such as galactic clusters, it does not expand in the solar system and moves us away from the other planets, or that the galaxies of the local group move away, because if it were like that, the milky way would never collide with andromeda ever.\\n\\n2) we are stardust: we have atoms of stars, but not only of them, other atoms are obtained from other means such as the collision of neutron stars, supernovas of type 1a or 1b, cosmic ray spacing and others.\\n\\n3) when a particle and antiparticle collide annihilate: for that \"annihilation\" must be of some particle with its corresponding antiparticle as an electron and a positron, it can not if it is electron and anti-proton for example. the truth is that they do not annihilate, they become more particles, you can understand this as joining 2 and -2 gives you 0 and from this 0 you can get other particles like 1 or -1, also if you have a certain energy you can create particles that have that same energy, for example if you have 4 and -4, you can get 3 and -3 on one side and 1 and -1 on the other.\\n\\n4) the cosmic microwave background is the echo or the light of the big bang: it would really be the light emitted 400,000 years after the big bang, since before that important things happened like the time of the great unification, the inflationary era, the hadron era, neutrino decoupling and much more. \\n \"the republican tax bill departs from tradition to specifically target citizens of democratic states

equations that bring a solution to the interaction in nature.\\n\\nnewton\\'s law of universal gravitation states that two celestial bodies attract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. this force is independent of the kinetic energies of the masses (static solution). the left wing of the equation below is the interacting force (effect, action or cause) and the right wing is the result as reaction of mass m2. it is apparent that, in this interaction, a reason causes a result but is not affected from it. in a sense, the result fully depends on the reason, but the reason is independent of result it causes.\\n\\nin einstein field equations, the force relation works with a rather strange logic. here too, the reason (the mass that creates the space-time curvature) is not affected by the result (the object following the shortest path along this curvature). there is also another unusual breaking off here: isolation of mathematics (geometry) from physics. the left side of the equation is the curved space-time geometry, while the right side is the physics thought to form this geometry. physicist john wheeler describes this situation as: \"space-time tells the matter how to move, and matter tells the space-time how to curve\". the \"cause\" and the \"result\" guide each other, but any one of them cannot affect the other, because the one is abstract mathematics, and the other is tangible physics.\\n\\nwe can hardly talk about cause-and-result relation in quantum physics. there is even no guarantee that a cause will have an expected consequence. there is complete uncertainty prevailing there and only possibilities are in question. some basic particles of constant magnitude are responsible from force relations, so the reason (force) is not influenced by its result, such that the interaction process in micro and macrocosm work in totally different way. therefore, efforts have almost no chance to achieve a unified theory with traditional physics logic.\\n\\non the other hand, the cause and result (action and reaction) in the field-relative model of the universe (uf-me) are interpreted together and inseparably (spotlight 10 in www.researchgate.net/publication/322317299). as you can see below, the right side of the equation is zero, and in the expression on the left side, the cause and result are considered together in a way that cannot be separated from each other. so, a reason causes a result and is affected by this result. in other words, a result emerges for some reason and becomes a part of the reason which is the source of its entity. since the \"uf-me\" is valid in every scale from atomic structure to cosmology, this form of relationship is universal. this way of operation in whole nature makes the dynamism and ceaseless change inevitable.\\n\\nsuch functioning in the nature is known as \"dialectic of nature\". it can also be called as \"dialectic of interaction\" or \"dialectic of action and reaction\". the dialectical method emerged in the ancient greek philosophy as a \"reasoning method using the antagonisms\". since 19th century german philosopher g.w.f. hegel interpreted the universe as a concrete idea, he added a material content to the dialectical relation. friedrich engels another german philosopher defined the dialectic as the scientific theory of totality in the context of the relationship of opponents in his unfinished work \"dialectic of nature\". \\n\\nthe dialectical method was used in ancient greece to reach the right result in idea debates. in marxist literature this was the fundamental method to explain the historical evolution of societies. the uf-me shows that the process of interaction in physical nature, based on action-reaction relation, is also a complete dialectical process. at each stage after the interaction process starts, the cause (force) is not the same as the one in previous stage, because it is affected from the reaction it created. the \"result\" in later stage will also change accordingly (continuous dynamism). in this process, cause and effect cannot be separated from each other and should be evaluated together (unity of opposites). in a sense, \"god does not play dice\". in my opinion the relativistic approach to the interaction in nature is the formulation of dialectic of nature and the uf-me is the mathematical expression of this concept. \\n\\nmost readers know now, how this dialectical method (uf-me) provides perfect solutions to gravitation and other major mysteries in cosmology and astronomy that cannot be explained by contemporary physics (www.researchgate.net/publication/321474644 and www.researchgate.net/publication/317845079). please keep in mind that the uf-me will present its principal revolutionary solutions at atomic and subatomic level. you had better follow me. \\n

(the spherical symmetric force relation requires rotating in random directions.)\\nthe uf-me is a single expression which is valid in every scale in the universe. readers can estimate that in the cosmic scale and visible universe with naked eye m_i?1 unit mass and r?1 unit distance while k_i?1, but in atomic and subatomic scale m_i?1 unit mass and r?1 unit distance while  k_i?1. the universal gravitation constant g  in uf-me serves in every scale because it is a parameter specifying space fabric as indicated in one of previous spotlights. (in contemporary physics  g has no role at all in atomic scale). \\n donald trump\\'s least presidential moments so far... \\n donald trump\\'s least presidential moments so far... \\n donald trump\\'s least presidential moments so far... \\n donald trump\\'s least presidential moments so far... \\n from m patricia mclaughlin...

training data i have has 5 attributes, 4 of which are independent.2 of the independent attributes are continuous and 2 are discrete.i have been working to fit this data into logistic regression model and generate predictions. now on this background i have couple of questions for which i require answers  -\\n\\nq1). does the ratio of my negative and positive cases in the training data affects learning of my regression model ?\\nq2). should i consider co-related attributes for training the model or only independent ones. does it affect performance or cost function ?\\n\\nwill seek

think there is not a bad chance that someone here will have some good suggestions.\\n\\ni have some data on a process ... this process occurs in the low five figures of per year and originates in a dozen or so different settings. there are about 8 or so variations of the process itself (some of which even merge but i want to ignore that for now). the process also has a handful of different outcomes. we know the duration of the process for all settings and outcome types although one outcome is \\'un-outcomed\\' which has a duration from origin until \\'today\\' (rolling).\\n\\nthere are some values for how long the process \\'should\\' take but sometimes it takes longer.\\n\\n what i want is one-big-in-your-face graphic that shows all of that.\\n\\na table won\\'t do it. a crude tree diagram won\\'t do it.\\n\\ni need a tree diagram template that allows me to do the following:\\n\\nfor each origin show branches from a tree with widths determined by the relative frequency of that source. for each sub-type of the process twigs coming off those branches also with their width determined by relative frequency of the whole. twigs should vary in length with the average duration of that sub-type coming from that origin. when a twig is longer than the recommended time it should change from green to red. \\n\\ndoes anyone know of (preferably free) software that can do

algorithm for getting data but the bigger question in front of me now is : \"what could be done with that data?\"\\n\\ni understand that it depends on the user, how he/she wants to look at the data and analyze it accordingly. but i want to provide some predefined utilities to the user, no matter whether the user fetches data from e-commerce websites or from social media ones.\\nplease guide me on this! :) \\n we\\'ve reached 1000 members!  :-d \\n hi everybody, \\n\\ni started this group slightly over a year ago in late december 2012 and it has been astonishing to see how quickly the group grew. and i take this as a sign that there is a desire for a forum like this to share ideas with other data scientists and individuals interested in big data.\\n\\nas the group grew in size, there were gradually more and more posts which were job offers or offers for various forms of training. i decided to allow this because at the time i felt that it these might be valuable resources for members in the community. however, this trend has spiraled out of hand and it now feels like those types of messages have drowned out the fruitful exchange of ideas that we once had in the community.\\n\\nthus, as of saturday january 11th 2014, any posts that are advertisements will be deleted and will be grounds for banishment from the group. this includes but is not limited to posts about job offers and paid trainings. \\n\\nif you wish to share information about a free educational resource such as new course on coursera, edx or udacity that you plan to sign up for or have taken in the past that is perfectly ok. you can also share about books, blog posts and podcasts that you have found useful so long as it is not self-promotion. use common sense when sharing with the community.\\n\\nwishing you all the best in your data science journey! - henrik nordmark \\n hi,\\n\\nanybody want,\\n\\nhadoop big-data  latest training videos \\n\\noracle bpm  11g training

limited to sql. i am thinking to learn hadoop and map reduce. do you think learning these two will give me any significant positive edge in my career? will it be at all possible for me to learn all these technical things considering that i am a business graduate? and by learning i mean ms from university. or should i go for mba in business analytics (focused for business students). need your expert opinion on this. thanks. :) \\n celebrating the fact that as of yesterday, i have an exciting new job doing data science for a digital marketing company! :-d\\n\\nand as if that were not good

question would be a bit noob .i think i have a hint of what big data is for ( base from random articles i found on the net)  but i\\'m completely confused on data science. do you need heavy mathematical background for it? sorry for the very noob question. i\\'ll try to read more so that i can contribute to the group :) \\n has anyone here read the nate silver book yet? if so what did you think? \\n would you like to buy an online bi, analytics and big data courses and certification package ? cost around usd $400 total. please help in answering to this small survey... we are working on

you\\'ve experienced, is there an awareness of those needs or is it the case that the sme needs to be educated about the benefits of data mining?\\n\\ni would imagine that sme\\'s in different industries would have both different needs and different levels of awareness of how those needs could be met through the power of data science techniques.\\n\\nany input on this would be greatly appreciated!\\n\\nkind regards,\\nhenrik. \\n how can i find the dataset, source code to implement about collaborative filtering and recommendation system, or another subject related big data, data

with data in a tangential way. mostly geospatial analysis, crime analysis and, descriptive statistics of educational data. i would like to pursue a path as a data analyst. i realize that sql skills are very important and i have studied this in the past but i really need to brush up. are there any free online courses that teach you sql and provide practice databases to query? also, which job roles should i look out for if becoming a data analyst is my ultimate goal? it seems companies want a lot of experience before considering you for this role. thanks in advance for the feedback. \\n

up to, in which contexts you have been or are interested in applying data science techniques. it would also be great to know a little bit about your backgrounds.\\n\\ni am originally a mathematician / logician by training but i have been moving more recently in a more applied direction using statistics to solve real world problems. i am currently working with vladimir metodiev on a project at a textile company.\\n\\nwhat interesting things have you been up to in data science?   :-) \\n sorry if this is a double posting or redundant in any way. saw it and i thought i would share with group... \\n\\nbig data computerworld strategy guide\\nperhaps you\\'ve heard that the next new thing in it is \\'big data\\' and concluded that the hype-cycle machine is turning out another attention-getter. i\\'m not big on predicting paradigm shifts, so i won\\'t in this case. but i will say that if you\\'re an it professional, you ignore big data at your peril. i believe this one is all it\\'s cracked up to be and more. read more. \\n we\\'ve just hit 80 members! woohoo! :-) \\n wow, there are a lot of new members! we\\'ve gone from a handful of people when i created the group 4 days ago to over 50 members today!  :-d\\n\\na very warm welcome to all of you who have just recently joined! i hope you find this to be a useful forum in which to share ideas, questions, techniques and in which to collaborate with others interested in data science. <3\\n\\nif you were dragged in here by a friend and are not that interested in being part of this group, there are no hard feelings in you choosing to leave. \\n\\nthe goal is for this community is to thrive with engaged members that actively interact and support one another in whatever way possible independently of whether the community is large or small.\\n\\nso far we have gone through an initial round of introductions and we have begun to compile a list of resources for data science. we have thread on free online courses in statistics, sql, hadoop, r and related topics. and we have an analogous thread on recommended books related to these topics.\\n\\nif you haven\\'t already done so, i would encourage you to scroll to the introductions thread and just say a few words about your background, your data science interests and any interesting data driven projects you have been involved in just to get a flavor for what everybody is up to.  :-) \\n this is a forum for big data, data science, data mining and statistics. \\n welcome to the big data, data science, data mining & statistics group! \\n '"

    "Final notes and improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the generated posts were mostly classified as male. that could be due to the fact that we scraped more male posts (1010) than female posts (571). It just so happens that more males commented in the public groups we scraped, and so they had a bigger impact in teaching the model. \n",
    "Improvement: As mentioned in the beginning of the assignment, we were only able to retrieve status messages, and the status author's name. We could NOT get the gender as facebook doesn't allow it. If we had a way to get the real gender of each author then the model would be a bit more accurate than to use an external classification package in order to determine the author's gender based on his/her name. \n",
    "Also, facebook did not allow scraping simply any group, but only public groups. So it was hard finding groups where the was an equal amount of activity of males and females, and that the statuses in those groups are not spam or commercialized material.\n",
    "Also, using 100 epoch wasn't optimal. The more epochs, the better, but as mentioned we were short on time. \n",
    "In addition to that, it is quite possible that using a model that generates text based on characters was not the best way to go, and we should have made use of other variants of models that generate text based on entire words."
